# **Welcome!**
This project is just a bunch of tools that can be used in electronics, but there will probably be a lot of othere "apps" that have nothing to do with electronics as well. Scrol down for setup.

## Setup
First, if you dont have python, install it in your terminal.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-3
```
Next, make a local clone of the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fast-Blast-Repos/ElectronicsTools.git
```
Now, simply run main.py by either double clicking it in the file explorer, or by using the following commands:
```bash
cd ElectronicsTools
python main.py
```
Please note that for linux, it might have to look like this:
```bash
cd ElectronicsTools
python3 main.py
```
Now just run the code whenever you want to use it. I reccomment adding a schortcut to main.py on your home screen.
