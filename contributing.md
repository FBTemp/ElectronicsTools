# Contributing Guide
Yes, contributing to this program can be difficult, and we do have guidelines, but we will discuss all of the above in this one document to ease up contrubuting. We really appreciate any contributions big or small. We value the importance of having a comunity that has a say in the matters of the project.

**WARNING: READ THE ENTIRE SECTION ABOUT THE PART THAT YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO BEFORE DOING SO!**

## Tips
To start off, here are some tips:
* Get VSCode and program from there when possible, it really eases up the process.
* Found a bug you don't know how to fix? Report it in the "Issues" tab. (little circle with a dot)

## Apps
Feel free to create your own apps for the ElectronicsTools! You can make anything as long as it is in python (or can be executed via a python file, wink, wink...)
### Who Owns The Apps
The apps are owned by the developers who made them. **DO NOT EDIT SOMEONE ELSE'S APP WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION, OR OUR PERMISSION.** Yes, this means that we are also in control of the apps, and by submitting them to the repository, you acknowledge that. An example of the proper legal documentation that should be placed at the beginning of apps. Also can be found at [assets/app_documentation.png](https://github.com/FBTemp/ElectronicsTools/blob/main/assets/app_documentation.png) or [assets/app_documentation.txt](https://github.com/FBTemp/ElectronicsTools/blob/main/assets/app_documentation.txt).
